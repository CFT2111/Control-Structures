/*
1) Create a JavaScript application that asks the user what their name is. If they answer 'Fred' feedback to the user telling tell them you like their name.
*/

/*
2) Create a JavaScript application that asks the user for 2 numbers and feeds back to the user with the highest of the two numbers.
*/

/*
3) Create a JavaScript application that asks the user for their age. If the user is older than 4 and younger than 16 feedback to the user telling them they should be at school.
*/

/*
4) Create a JavaScript a simple quiz program. The program should ask the user for the name of the world's first computer programmer. If the user responds with 'Ada Lovelace' or 'Lovelace' the program should feedback telling them they are correct.
*/

/*
5) Create a JavaScript program that asks the user for three numbers and feeds back to the user with the lowest of the three numbers.

/*
Most students find the following questions a bit more difficult, so don't worry too much if you can't get the programs to work/aren't sure about how to answer the question. Even if you are attempting the questions and thinking about how to provide a solution you are learning. You can use the solutions to see example answers.
*/

/*
6) In question 4 it is possible that the user will enter the answer in lower case e.g. 'lovelace'. Do some research do find out how the case of string data can be converted from upper to lower case - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase. Modify your answer to question 4 to make the program more robust i.e it doesn't matter what case the user uses to answer the question and the program still works.

/*
7) This program has been started for you. It is a simple JavaScript quiz. Add some more JavaScript that will test the user's answers, calculate a score for the user, and feedback to the user e.g. 'You scored 2 out of 3'. (Hint: you might want to use the increment operator ++ e.g. score++;)
*/

/*
let score = 0;
const capitalEngland = prompt("What is the capital of England");
const capitalFrance = prompt("What is the capital of France");
const capitalGermany = prompt("What is the capital of Germany");

/*
8) Factory owners SlaveDrivers Inc. pay their workers a basic wage of £2.40 an hour. If an employee works over 40 hours a week they receive £3.60 an hour for every hour of overtime they work. Workers can work a maximum of 80 hours a week. Write a JavaScript application that allows workers to enter the number of hours they have worked. The program should then feedback to the user telling them their wages for the week.
*/

/*
9) The lecture slides  consider the use of the isNaN() function. Think about how you could use isNaN() to test if the user has entered a number e.g. for the previous question.
